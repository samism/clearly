# Changelog (iOS)

iOS release notes. Mac release notes live in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-12
- Refocused as a clean, distraction-free markdown editor — the vault sidebar, full-text search, quick switcher, backlinks, outline, and tags surfaces have been removed in favor of the system document browser
- Tapping a .md in Files.app now shows a rendered preview (math, mermaid, syntax highlighting) instead of raw text
- Files icon view shows a real thumbnail with the document's first heading and body lines
- Restored .md routing so opening from Mail, Safari, or any other app hands off to Clearly

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-29
- Find + Replace across the editor, with stale-highlight fix
- Fold and unfold code blocks in Preview and Live Preview

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-28
- Long-press a file in the sidebar for Move, Duplicate, Share, and inline Rename
- Click any mermaid diagram in preview to zoom it full-screen
